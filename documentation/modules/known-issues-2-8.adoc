{project-first} 2.8 has the following known issues:

.Trusted Platform Module is added to the BIOS of a Windows Server 2022 VM after warm migration
After warm migration of Windows Server 2022 virtual machine (VM) from vSphere to an {ocp-name} cluster, the Trusted Platform Module (TPM) device is added to the target VMs, even if the TPM configuration is non-persistent in the BIOS setting of the source Windows Server 2022 VM. This prevents the target VM from starting. link:https://issues.redhat.com/browse/MTV-2049[(MTV-2049)]

.Linux VM with clustered file systems are not supported
Linux guest VMs with clustered file systems on a shared disk are not supported, as these disks are not added to the guest conversion process. The `virt-v2v` tool does not update shared disks in the `fstab` configuration file. link:https://issues.redhat.com/browse/MTV-2145[(MTV-2145)]

.Migrating shared boot disks is not available
Migrating shared boot disks by using {project-short} is not available. link:https://issues.redhat.com/browse/MTV-2201[(MTV-2201)]

.Anti-virus software on VMware VMs can cause migrations to fail
VMware only: Anti-virus software can cause VMware migrations to fail. It is strongly recommended to remove such software from source VMs before you start a migration. link:https://issues.redhat.com/browse/MTV-2145[(MTV-2145)]
